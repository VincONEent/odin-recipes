# odin-recipes
My version of the odin recipes project

From my background that project was basic, but i'm glad i did it because i was
faced with a bug that took a few minutes to get to the core of the echues.
My lists on the second recipe page i worked ON we're not displaying correctly :
The ingredients were aligned horrizontally, same thing happened to preparations
instructions.

The actual bug turned out to be a mistake on my part, on every single balise of
the lists i used <il></il> instead <li></li>.

We'll come back to that project shortly to improve the look of it, hopefully
with CSS.
